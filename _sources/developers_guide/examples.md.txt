# Examples

:::{note}
Basic usage of examples is explained in the {ref}`getting-started` section.
:::

Examples provided with this project should cover from very simple designs to complex fully synthesizable cores.
They should be sorted by increasing complexity and number of used features, e.g:
- 101: minimal base design
- 102: introduce user to parameters
- 103: introduce user to slicing
- 104: introduce user to interfaces
- 105: etc.

Developers are encouraged to create/add new examples in the same spirit.
Simple examples are used to teach how to use this tool and demonstrate its features.
Real-world use cases are also welcome to prove that the implementation is mature enough to handle practical designs.
