# Kenning Pipeline Manager

Topwrap can make use of [Kenning Pipeline Manager](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-pipeline-manager) to visualize the process of creating block design.

## Run Topwrap with Pipeline Manager

1. Build and run Pipeline Manager server

    In order to start creating block design in Pipeline Manager, you need to first build and run a server application - here is a brief instruction on how to achieve this (the process of building and installation of Pipeline Manager is described in detail in its [documentation](https://antmicro.github.io/kenning-pipeline-manager/project-readme.html#building-and-running)):

    ```
    python -m topwrap kpm_build_server
    python -m topwrap kpm_run_server
    ```

    After executing the above-mentioned commands, the Pipeline Manager server is waiting for an external application (i.e. Topwrap) to connect on `127.0.0.1:9000` and you can connect to the web GUI frontend in your browser on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. Establish connection with Topwrap

    Once the Pipeline Manager server is running, you can now launch Topwrap's client application in order to connect to the server. You need to specify:
    * IP address (`127.0.0.1` is default)
    * listening port (`9000` is default)
    * yamls describing IP cores, that will be used in the block design

    An example command, that runs Topwrap's client, may look like this:
    ```
    python -m topwrap kpm_client -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 \
        topwrap/ips/axi/axi_axil_adapter.yaml \
        examples/pwm/ipcores/{litex_pwm.yml,ps7.yaml}
    ```

3. Create block design in Pipeline Manager

    Upon successful connection to a Pipeline Manager server, Topwrap will generate and send to the server a specification describing the structure of previously selected IP cores. After that, you are free to create a custom block design by means of:
    * adding IP core instances to the block design. Each Pipeline Manager's node has `delete` and `rename` options, which make it possible to remove the selected node and change its name respectively. This means that you can create multiple instances of the same IP core.
    * adjusting IP cores' parameters values. Each node may have input boxes in which you can enter parameters' values (default parameter values are added while adding an IP core to the block design):
    ```{image} img/node_parameters.png
    ```
    * connecting IP cores' ports and interfaces. Only connections between ports or interfaces of matching types are allowed. This is automatically checked by Pipeline Manager, as the types of nodes' ports and interfaces are contained in the loaded specification, so Pipeline Manager will prevent you from connecting non-matching interfaces (e.g. *AXI4* with *AXI4Lite* or a port with an interface). A green line will be displayed if a connection is possible to create, or a red line elsewhere:
    ```{image} img/invalid_connection.png
    ```
    * specifying external ports or interfaces in the top module. This can be done by adding `External Input`, `External Output` or `External Inout` metanodes and creating connections between them and chosen ports or interfaces. Note that you should adjust the name of the external port or interface in a textbox inside selected metanode. In the example below, output port `pwm` of `litex_pwm_top` IP core will be made external in the generated top module and the external port name will be set to `ext_pwm`:
    ```{image} img/external_port.png
    ```
    Note, that you don't always have to create a new block design by hand - you can use a {ref}`design import <import-design>` feature to load an existing block design from a description in Topwrap's yaml format.

    An example block design in Pipeline Manager for the PWM project may look like this:

    ```{image} img/pwm_design.png
    ```

## Pipeline Manager features

While creating a custom block design, you can make use of the following Pipeline Manager's features:
* export (save) design to a file
* import (load) design from a file
* validate design
* build design

(export-design)=

### Export design to yaml description file

Created block design can be saved to a {ref}`design description file <design-description>` in yaml format, using Pipeline Manager's `Save file` option.
Target location on the filesystem can then be browsed in a filesystem dialog window.

(import-design)=

### Import design from yaml description file

Topwrap also supports conversion in the opposite way - block design in Pipeline Manager can be generated from a yaml design description file using `Load file` feature.

(validate-design)=

### Design validation

Pipeline Manager is capable of performing some basic checks at runtime such as interface type checking while creating a connection. However you can also run more complex tests by using Pipeline Manager's `Validate` option. Topwrap will then respond with a validity confirmation or error messages. The rules you need to follow in order to keep your block design valid are:
* multiple IP cores with the same name are not allowed (except from external metanodes).
* parameters values can be integers of different bases (e.g. `0x28`, `40` or `0b101000`) or arithmetic expressions, that are later evaluated using [numexpr.evaluate()](https://numexpr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#numexpr.evaluate) function (e.g. `(AXI_DATA_WIDTH+1)/4` is a valid parameter value assuming that a parameter named `AXI_DATA_WIDTH` exists in the same IP core). You can also write a parameter value in a Verilog format (e.g. `8'b00011111` or `8'h1F`) - in such case it will be interpreted as a fixed-width bit vector.
* a single port or interface cannot be external and connected to another IP core at the same time.
* connections between two external metanodes are not allowed.
* all the created external output or inout ports must have unique names. Only multiple input ports of IP cores can be driven be the same external signal.

Topwrap can also generate warnings if:
* some ports or interfaces remain unconnected.
* multiple ports are connected to an `External Input` metanode with an empty `External Name` property.
* `inout` ports of two modules are connected together (all `inout` ports are required to be directly connected to `External Inout` metanodes)

If a block design validation returns a warning, it means that the block design can be successfully built, but it is recommended to follow the suggestion and resolve a particular issue.

(build-design)=

### Building design

Once the design has been created and tested for validity, you can build design using `Run` button. If the design does not contain any errors, this will result in creating a top module in a directory where `topwrap kpm_client` was ran, similarly when using Topwrap's `topwrap build` command.
